## Crypto Vision

Crypto Vision helps you seamlessly calculate fiat price of cryptocurrency! This productivity tool will supercharge your hunt for the rarest NFTs or yield farming on your favorite DeFi protocol! Install it in [Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/crypto-vision/monhoopbembpakajfdddjbkmnpnfanod). Works just fine on all Chromium-based browsers, for example Brave Browser.

The extension has 2 modes - `Search Bar` and `Highlighter` and supports top **1000** cryptos by market cap!

#### Search Bar:

-   Type in "cv" into your search bar, and then type in any crypto, for example "0.23 BTC", "37 ETH" or "123,433.77 APT"
-   The USD value will show up below
-   Hitting Enter will take you to the CoinGecko page of the crypto selected

#### Highlighter:

-   Simply navigate to any crypto-related page
-   The extension will find crypto amounts like "0.23 BTC", "37 ETH" or "123,433.77 APT" in the page and highlight them
-   Hover over the highlighted value to see its USD price

#### Warnings:

-   CoinGecko price feed likes to throttle users. If the highlights are not showing up, wait 5-10 minutes for prices to sync
-   Crypto Vision displays best-effort prices. They might be up to 5 minutes behind actual prices.
-   Highlighter can sometimes break visual display of the page. If this happens, simply turn it off while using such page, and turn it back on once you're done
